# Where Ya Ride (name pending)

The purpose of this project is to build a free, open source app for all things [NORTA](http://norta.com) (**N**ew **O**rleans **R**egional **T**ransit **A**uthority).

Our goal is to make navigating the system easier for people who are used to getting information on their phones and we hope that we can increase ridership among this group.

We are trying to build something similar to [TransitApp](https://transitapp.com/) but hyperfocused on New Orleans.

### Milestones

Our milestones are as follows:

1. Simple and accurate schedule (GTFS data) navigation.
2. Have releases in both App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android).
3. Multi-modal Trip planning (OpenTripPlanner or Google API).
4. Realtime updates (when we are given access to the new AVL system).
