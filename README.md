# Where Ya Ride (name pending)

The purpose of this project is to build a free, open source app for all things [NORTA](http://norta.com) (**N**ew **O**rleans **R**egional **T**ransit **A**uthority).

Our goal is to make navigating the system easier for people who are used to getting information on their phones and we hope that we can increase ridership among this group.

### Milestones

Our milestones are as follows:

1. Simple and accurate schedule (GTFS data) navigation.
2. Multi-modal Trip planning (OpenTripPlanner).
3. Have a beta available on both iOS and Android.
4. Realtime updates (when we are given access to the new AVL system).
